# Title
Fitness Tracker


## App
https://cjb-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com/


## Description
Fitness Tracker is a simple app that allows users to track their cardio and resitance exercise.


## Motivation
I undertook this project to increase my knowledge and understanding of Mongo DB as part of my coding bootcamp program.  The project uses a number of native and third-party modules.  While the app itself is not groundbreaking, the code may be particularly interesting to those interested in learning Mongo DB.


## User Story
**As a** user,

**I want to** track my cardio and resistance exercise

**So I can** keep track of my fitness efforts.


## Acceptance Criteria
The application should allow users to:
+ enter an exercise with relevant details about the exercise;
+ add more that one 
+ remove a burger from the tracking app once the burger is server (because the order is complete).
